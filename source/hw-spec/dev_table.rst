Device Table
============
The collection of :ref:`devices <device>` governed by a :ref:`controller
<controller>` is referred to as a device table. The :ref:`controller <controller>`
is responsible for creating this aggregate and sending it to the computer
following a reset. The table consists of an :ref:`addressed <dev-address>` list
of :ref:`device descriptors <dev-desc>`.

.. _dev-address:

Device Address
--------------
Each :ref:`device descriptor <dev-desc>` entry in the device table requires a
device address. This is a unique, 32-bit number with the following format:

::

       Reserved(16-bit).Hub_Index(8-bit).Device_Index(8-bit)

* ``Reserved``: Reserved bits. Must be all zeros.
* ``Hub_Index``: The index of the :ref:`hub <hub>` within the :ref:`controller
  <controller>` that the device is managed by.
* ``Device_Index``: A unique index of each device within its :ref:`hub <hub>`.
  A valid ``Device_Index`` ranges from 0 to 0xFD. 0xFE is reserved and 0xFF
  indicates an invalid device.

Device Registers
==================

.. _reg-type:

Register Type
--------------

Device registers can be separated into two types:

-  **Raw registers**: Those that correspond 1:1 to the physical register space
   of an external electrical component (e.g., the register map in the
   manufacturer datasheet of a sensor IC).
-  **Managed registers**: Those designed to interface exclusively with an ONI
   system, usually implemented in firmware and described in a :ref:`ONI Device
   Datasheet <dev-datasheet>`.

Raw registers provide a direct window to the underlying hardware. On the other
hand, managed registers provide flexibility and abstract control over device
state. For instance, managed registers may provide access to abstract properties
that require access to multiple physical registers in hardware, which can all be
completed in a single register read or write cycle. Thus the firmware can
manage low-level raw access to the hardware, while exposing only high-level
abstract registers in order to simplify the interface to user applications.

Register Access and Update
-----------------------------

Registers, independently of their :ref:`type <reg-type>`, can be defined as
Read/Write, Read-Only or Write-Only. All registers MUST have a valid value at
power-on. Whenever a device receives a reset request generated by the
controller, registers might either be reset to their power-on value or keep
their current value. This can be defined independently for each register.

All register writes, regardless of reset behavior, MUST be immediate (i.e., for
a Read/Write register, reading a register after being written must reflect the
new value). However, the *effects* of a register might not occur until the next
reset. An example of this type of behavior is registers that operate on the
:ref:`device descriptor <dev-desc>`. The descriptor must be static during
runtime, but registers affecting it might take action after a reset, providing
an updated descriptor to the controller.

Register access, bit-field definitions, reset behavior, and time of effect MUST
be specified in the hardware datasheet for raw registers or the :ref:`ONI Device
Datasheet <dev-datasheet>` for managed registers.

.. _dev-reg-map:

Register Map
-------------

A device can optionally implement raw registers and MUST implement at least one
managed register, ``ENABLE``. This register's behavior MUST conform the
following rules:

- Bits 31 down to 1 of the ``ENABLE`` are reserved.
- For devices that produce data through the :ref:`data-rd-chan`, ``ENABLE`` is a
  Read/Write register that takes effect after reset. When ``ENABLE`` is set to
  0x00000000, the device MUST NOT produce any data on the :ref:`data-rd-chan`.
  When ``ENABLE`` is set to 0x00000001, the device MUST produce data on the
  :ref:`data-rd-chan` in accordance with behavior documented on its
  :ref:`dev-datasheet`.
- For devices that do not produce data through the :ref:`data-rd-chan`,
  ``ENABLE`` is a Read-Only register with value 0. Attempting to write to the
  register results in ``CONFIGWNACK`` on the :ref:`sig-chan`.

The location of the managed registers depends on the existence of raw registers.
If the device implements raw registers, those are mapped to addresses 0x00000000
to 0x00007FFF, corresponding to the same address map of the underlying hardware,
and managed registers start from 0x00008000. If no raw registers are present,
managed registers start from 0x00000000 instead.

The ``ENABLE`` register MUST be the first of the managed registers, at
0x00000000 if no raw registers are present, 0x00008000 if raw registers are
implemented.

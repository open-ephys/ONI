Data Frames
============

Data transmission from the :ref:`read channel<data-rd-chan>` and from the
:ref:`write channel<data-wr-chan>` is packed in frames. Each frame is a
timestamped `type-length-value-encoded
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type%E2%80%93length%E2%80%93value>`__ structure
that contains data corresponding to a single device :ref:`sample <dev-sample>`.
The frame format is:

::

    uint32  dev_addr
    uint64  acqclk_cnt
    uint32  sample_sz
    var     sample

Where

- ``dev_addr``: Device Address. The address of the device producing the data, as featured
  on the :ref:`device table <dev-table>`.
- ``acqclk_cnt``: Acquisition counter. A counter common to all devices generated by the
  controller common acquisition clock. On write frames, this field is ignored.
- ``sample_sz``: Sample Size. The full size of the sample, and must be equal to the
  ``rd_samp_size`` field of the :ref:`device descriptor <dev-desc>` on read
  frames or a multiple of the ``wr_samp_size`` on write frames.
- ``sample``: The complete data sample as described on the :ref:`device sample
  format <dev-sample>` section.

  While a read frame must always contain a single sample as generated by the devices, 
  write frames can contain multiple samples targeted to the same device.

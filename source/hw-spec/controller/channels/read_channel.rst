Read Channel
=============

-  **Data alignment** : 8 bits
-  **Channel type** : Stream
-  **Direction** : Read

The read channel provides high bandwidth communication from the controller to
the host computer. Data from the read stream of all devices that support it is
aggregated and multiplexed by the controller and sent to the host through this
channel in the form of :ref:`frame`.

Data should be pushed to this channel by the controller as quickly as possible.
It is the responsibility of the host computer to read data from the stream
quickly enough to keep up with data production by the controller. Therefore, it
is highly recommended that an ONI system implements some kind of internal
buffering to ameliorate the effects of uneven read times caused by computer
operating systems or other software limitations.

.. _read-word-alignment:

Read Word Alignment
---------------------

Hardware implementations of controllers might require a :ref:`word
size<read-word-alignment-reg>` greater than 8 bits. In that case, the controller
MUST increase the ``rd_samp_size`` provided each devices' :ref:`dev-desc` within
the :ref:`dev-table` so they fit into the required word alignment. Extra bytes
after the size defined on the :term:`Device Datasheet`'s
:ref:`dev-datasheet-read-format` will be padded with 0xFF.
